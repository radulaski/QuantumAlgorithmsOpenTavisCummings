## Digital Quantum Simulations of the Open Non-Resonant Tavis--Cummings Model Code

This repo contains:

- A .ipynb file to run the J-Matrix algorithm
- A .ipynb file to run the Split J-Matrix algorithm
- A .ipynb file to run a hybrid algorithm between Split J-Matrix and WML

If there are qiskit import errors, make sure Python version is compatible with qiskit or run locally using Python 3.7 or 3.8.
Qiskit version must be 0.45.
